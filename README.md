## Description
This project is a small personal project to start using GitHub and understand how it works. 
I'm making an RPG in Game Maker studio and want to see how far it goes. 
I don't have the whole story planned, so meanwhile I'm starting with the basic stuff: controls, core features, visuals...

## Controls
- Move using the arrows 
- Full screen using F4. 

## Versions
-	V1.0 Created the game, added Player with a temporal Sprite, added movement, added walls which Player can collission with
-	V1.1 Changed Player's screen, now can toggle full screen, changed the resolution and added a viewport

I'll add more functions in the future
